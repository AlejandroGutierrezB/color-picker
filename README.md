# Color Picker Tool

This project is a canvas-based color dropper tool built with **React** and **Vite**. The tool allows users to select colors from a canvas, displaying the hex code of the color and magnifying the area being hovered over.

## Features

- **Canvas Rendering**: Handles large canvases (up to 4000x4000 pixels or 16MB).
- **Color Dropper Tool**: Lets users hover over the canvas to pick a color.
- **Dynamic Circle**: A circle dynamically displays the hex code of the color being hovered over.
  - The circleâ€™s border changes to the hovered color.
  - The circle magnifies the area under the cursor.
- **Typescript**: The entire project is written in **Typescript** for type safety and better code maintainability.
